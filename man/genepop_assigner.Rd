or a dataframe read in with tab seperation, header=FALSE , quote="", and stringsAsFactors=FALSE.
This will be the standard genepop format with a the first n+1 rows corresponding to the n loci names,

\item{popgroup}{if specified (Default: NULL) popgroup is a dataframe or path to a csv.
This dataframe contains two columns. Column 1 corresponds to the population names. These names
should match the individual IDs (e.g. BON_01 ,  110110 would be 'BON'). The next column
has the group. These values must be numeric. If groupings are the same as populations then leave as NULL (Default).}
